# Objective: Learn about S3 buckets, object storage, and basic bucket policies.

## Prerequisites: IAM user with S3 access (from Lab 2)

### Steps:

1. In IAM, ensure you have permissions to create S3 buckets (you can grant AmazonS3FullAccess temporarily for lab convenience if needed; ideally use a scoped policy).
2. Open S3 service → Create bucket.
  Choose a unique bucket name (e.g., clfx-lab-bucket-<your initials>).
  Select region.
  Keep Block Public Access on; uncheck if you want public access (not recommended for beginners).
  Leave other defaults and create the bucket.
3. Open the newly created bucket → Upload → Add files.
4. Upload a small text file (e.g., hello-lab.txt) with some content.
5. (Optional) Enable versioning on the bucket.
6. Retrieve the object URL and try to download the file.

## Expected Results:

Bucket is created and your file is uploaded.
You can access the file via the object URL if permissions allow.

## Assessment / Checklist:

1. Bucket created in appropriate region
2. File uploaded successfully
3. (Optional) Versioning enabled
